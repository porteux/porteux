Cheatcodes for PorteuX
=======================================

Boot parameters (also known as cheatcodes) are used to affect the
booting process of PorteuX. The cheatcodes listed here are only those
that are specific to Porteux (see the final note for information on
cheatcodes that apply to all linux distributions, including Porteux).
You can use these parameters to disable desired kinds of hardware
detection, start Porteux from a specific location, load additional
modules, etc.

Reboot your computer and wait several seconds until the graphical
Porteux logo appears with a boot menu. Choose your desired menu
entry and hit Tab, which will allow you to edit the command line.
Add your desired boot argument from the list below to affect booting
the way you like.
Here's an example of what the boot line would look like, adding the
noauto and copy2ram cheatcodes to a standard Porteux boot option
(which already has some other cheatcodes by default):

APPEND initrd=initrd.xz changes=/porteux/ noauto copy2ram

These cheatcodes can also be added to the APPEND line of your
/boot/syslinux/porteux.cfg entries (or other bootloader config files)
to apply them automatically on every boot.

---------------------------------------

List of available cheatcodes in alphabetical order:
NOTE: Example cheatcodes are sometimes listed below inside single
quotes (e.g. 'example=somevalue') for clarity in the documentation.
When you enter these cheatcodes during boot time or in your
porteux.cfg, you should not use these quote marks.

base_only

   ... This cheatcode will prevent the system from loading any
       modules at startup other than the 'base' modules included
       with the default ISO (000-kernel.xzm, 001-core.xzm, etc).
       This is useful in debugging to see if problems you are
       having are associated with some module you've added to the
       system.

changes=/dev/device
changes=/path/
changes=/path/file.dat

   ... All changes made in Porteux are kept in memory until you reboot.
       With this boot parameter, you tell Porteux to use a device
       (or a file or directory) other than your memory for storing
       changes. You can, for example, format your disk partition
       /dev/sdb2 with some Linux filesystem (eg. xfs) and then use
       'changes=/dev/sdb2' to store all changes to that partition.
       This way you won't lose your changes after reboot.
   ... If you use a file image instead of a device, and the image
       contains a valid filesystem, Porteux will mount it on a loop
       device and will store changes to it.
   ... If you use a directory, Porteux will save changes to it (it
       will make a 'changes' subdirectory there). This should only
       be used for linux filesystems, if changes need to be saved to a
       FAT or NTFS partition, a savefile container has to be used.

changes-ro

   ... Keep saved changes in a read-only state. This is useful when
       you have your system set up exactly how you like it and do not
       want to save any other changes you might make during a live
       session. This cheatcode should be used in conjunction with the
       'changes=' or 'changes=EXIT:' cheatcodes.
       Example: 'changes=/path/file.dat changes-ro'
       NOTE: remove the 'changes-ro' cheatcode from the bootloader config
       to start saving changes as normal (effective after a reboot).

cliexec=my_script
cliexec=my_script;reboot

   ... Execute specified command(s) in runlevel 3 (before logging
       in to a graphical interface).
       Use semicolons (;) as command separators with no spaces.
   ... If you need to use spaces in the command line, replace them
       with '~'. For example, 'cliexec=echo~Shutting~power;poweroff'
       will echo your text with spaces instead of '~'.
       NOTE: to start graphical applications please use 'guiexec='
       cheatcode instead.

copy2ram

   ... Copy all modules to RAM. You'll need at least 256MB of RAM
       to boot Porteux properly. 64-bit Porteux with KDE-4 requires
       at least 768MB of RAM for this.
       Copy2ram slows down the boot phase but speeds up Porteux!

       Reminder: the 'noeject' cheatcode can be used together with
       'copy2ram' to prevent unmounting of your booting media
       (CD/DVD disc, USB, card readers, etc).
       You can also use the 'rammod' cheatcode to selectively load
       modules to RAM - see the 'rammod' description below.

debug

   ... Start the shell several times during the boot to perform
       debugging actions.

delay=some_value

   ... To be used for devices which need extra time to settle up.
       Example: 'delay=5' will cause a 5 second delay before Porteux
       starts booting.

extramod=/path/folder_with_modules
extramod=/path/folder_with_modules;/path2/folder_with_modules

   ... This cheatcode lets you load modules from one or more external
       folders that are located outside of the /porteux directory.
       Multiple folders can be specified, with full paths separated by
       a semicolon without any spaces.
       Examples:
       'extramod=/mnt/sdb3/porteux-modules'
       'extramod=/mnt/sdb3/porteux-modules;/mnt/sdc4/inkscape_modules'

from=/mnt/partition
from=/path/folder
from=/path/porteux.iso

   ... Loads Porteux from the specified partition, folder or ISO file.
       Examples:
       'from=/mnt/sdb2' will attempt to load unpacked Porteux ISO from
       the second partition on your second drive.
       'from=/mnt/sda2/linux-testing' will attempt to load unpacked ISO
       from the 'linux-testing' folder placed on the second partition.
       'from=/mnt/sda1/porteux-test.iso' will attempt to load the Porteux
       data from 'porteux-test.iso'.

       If the destination partition is not provided with this
       cheatcode, the booting script will search through all available
       devices for your data.

fsck

   ... Enables a filesystem check for ext(2,3,4) partitions during
       boot time before anything is mounted by Porteux. XFS does
       not need fsck as a check is performed automatically during
       the mount operation.
       NOTE:  On some systems, you will need to use the 'delay='
       cheatcode in order to allow your devices to settle up.

guiexec=my_script
guiexec=firefox;pidgin

   ... Execute specified command(s) in runlevel 4, when the graphical
       interface is loaded; unlike 'cliexec' this cheatcode can be
       used to start graphical applications.
       Use semicolons (;) as command separators with no spaces.
   ... If you need to use spaces in the command line, replace them
       with '~'.
       Example: 'guiexec=firefox~kernel.org' will open the firefox
       browser on the 'kernel.org' website.

kmap=keyboardmap
kmap=keyboardmap1,keyboardmap2,keyboardmap3
kmap=keyboardmap:variant

   ... Specifies the preferred keyboard layout for KDE/LXDE/XFCE or
       other desktop. A full list of supported layouts can be found in
       the /etc/X11/xkb/symbols folder. Up to 3 layouts are supported.
       Example: 'kmap=ara,us' will set the Arabic keyboard layout at
       startup. 'kmap=ara,us' will keep Arabic layout as default
       with possibility of switching to 'us' by 'alt+shift' key
       combination.
       Keyboard layout variants are also supported.
       Example: 'kmap=pl:qwertz' will set the polish keyboard layout
       with 'qwertz' as a variant.

load=module
load=module[1];module[n]

   ... Load optional modules from /optional/ directory on the booting
       media. Additional modules can be listed, separated
       by semicolons, without spaces.
       Example: 'load=gimp;inkscape' would search for and load any
       modules in the /porteux/optional folder that contain the strings
       'gimp' or 'inkscape'.

login=user_name

   ... Lets you specify the name of the user (could be also 'root')
       which will be autologged into GUI session.
       If username is not provided then booting stops on the lxdm/kdm
       login screen.

mopt

   ... This cheatcode will allow you to customize your filesystem
       mount options.  By default, the mount options for all
       filesystems in Porteux are: "noatime,nodiratime,suid,dev,exec,async".
       Each option must be separated with a comma "," with no spaces
       between any characters.
       Example: 'mopt=realtime,sync,users,nosuid,noexec'
       See 'man mount' for more information on specific mount options.

noauto

   ... Do not mount any devices during startup.
       Every disk needs to be mounted manually in order to access it.

nocd

   ... Do not discover any optical devices during startup.

noeject

   ... Do not eject CD/DVD disc during boot time and shutdown.

       NOTE: when the 'copy2ram' cheatcode is used with 'noeject',
       this will prevent the unmounting of your booting media
       (CD/DVD disc, USB, card readers, etc). To eject the CD you
       will have to umount /mnt/sr0 manually and issue the command
       'eject /dev/sr0' from a console.

nohd

   ... Do not discover any hard drives during startup.

nohotplug

   ... Disable specified hardware autodetection in the case of
       hangups. None of your hardware will be detected, and you'll
       have to use the "modprobe" command after logging in to
       text mode and load all needed drivers manually.

noload=module
noload=module[1];module[n]

   ... Disable loading of any modules specified. This affects all the
       modules on the Porteux booting media, including /base and /modules
       folders, so using noload=kde will disable loading of all modules
       with 'kde' in the name. It is useful with the copy2ram cheatcode,
       because any un-used module is not copied to ram.  Multiple modules
       can be listed, but they must be separated by semicolons, with no
       spaces.
       Example: 'noload=lxde;devel' will prevent the loading of any
       modules with a name containing the strings 'lxde' or 'devel'

nobluetooth

   ... Does not enable bluetooth daemon at boot. You
       can still enable it via PorteuX Settings Centre.

nomagic

   ... Do not bind "magic folders" during boot time. Useful when
       something went wrong with your Porteux configuration and you
       want to boot into true 'Always Fresh' mode.

nonetwork

   ... This boot parameter will prevent Porteux from automatically
       establishing a network connection on start-up.
       Note that this cheatcode makes some modifications to
       your system which must be manually restored, so it is
       recommended that you only use this cheatcode in "Always
       Fresh" mode. If you've ignored this advice and need to
       recover your network connection, please run the following:

       chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 /etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager
       sed -i 's/Hidden=true//g' /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop

norootcopy

   ... Do not copy files from your rootcopy directory at boot-up.
       Like the 'nomagic' cheatcode, this is useful if something went
       wrong with your Porteux configuration and you want to boot into
       true 'Always Fresh' mode.

noswap

   ... Prevents the automatic use of an existing swap partition.
       By default, Porteux searches your attached drives for
       partitions that are formatted as swap, and will mount them
       for use within Porteux. The 'noswap' cheatcode disables
       this behaviour.

ramsize=some_value%

   ... Will let you set a custom size for the tmpfs partition
       which is used as the root (/) of your live filesystem
       when changes are not saved on a real filesystem
       (i.e., Always Fresh mode). The default value is 60% of
       available RAM memory.
       Example: 'ramsize=40%'

rammod=module
rammod=folder
rammod=module[1];module[n];folder[1];folder[2]

   ... Specify module(s) or folder(s) containing modules which should
       be copied to RAM when using the 'copy2ram' cheatcode.  This
       allows you to have the speed benefit of 'copy2ram' for the
       modules you use the most, without occupying your RAM with those
       modules that you make use of less often.  Any modules that are
       not specified will be mounted in place on the block device, so
       your device will remain mounted while Porteux is running.

       You can use a full or partial names for your search string,
       but keep in mind that all modules and folders that match your
       string will be loaded into RAM; if you have extra modules in a
       folder named 'lxde' and you use 'rammod=lxde', then the module
       003-lxde.xzm from /porteux/base will be loaded in addition to
       all modules in the 'lxde' folder.

       NOTE: 'rammod' cannot be used without 'copy2ram', and it also
       will not load modules from /porteux/optional or external
       locations unless you also specify these modules with the
       'load=' or 'extramod=' cheatcodes.

       Examples:
       'rammod=001;002;004;firefox'
       'extramod=/mnt/sdb3/porteux/gimp rammod=001;002;gimp'

rootcopy=/path/to_folder/with_files

   ... Copy files from specified directory directly to the live
       filesystem. This directory will be used instead of the
       traditional /porteux/rootcopy.
       Example: 'rootcopy=/mnt/sda5/porteux-files'

cfgfile=some_name.sgn

   ... This cheatcode specifies the *.cfg file which Porteux will
       search for.  This is useful when you want to store several
       Porteux editions on one disk/disc.
       Example: 'cfgfile=porteux-usb.cfg'

storage=/path/folder
storage=/path/file.dat

   ... This cheatcode takes action only when used together with the
       'pxe' cheatcode. It tells the server to store persistent
       changes from the clients in a specified folder. Changes must
       be saved on a real and writeable filesystem (will not work with
       aufs).
       Separate folders for each client will be created with the name
       '/path/folder/client-xxxx' where xxxx is the last 4 characters
       of the clients' NIC MAC address.
       This cheatcode should be used on the server side.
       Example: 'storage=/mnt/sda3/pxe-clients'

timezone=region/zone

   ... Tell Porteux the correct timezone for your location.  By default,
       this assumes that your hardware clock is set to localtime.  To use
       a timezone with a hardware clock set to UTC time instead, also
       add the 'utc' cheatcode.
       A full listing of available timezones can be found in the file
       /usr/sbin/timeconfig.
       Example: 'timezone=Europe/Warsaw'
       Example: 'timezone=Factory'

utc

   ... Tell Porteux that your hardware clock is set to UTC time and
       not to localtime.  Most computers that have Windows installed on
       them use localtime instead of UTC time, but many UNIX machines
       use UTC instead.  This cheatcode is normally used together with
       the 'timezone' cheatcode.
       Example: 'timezone=Europe/Warsaw utc'

vga_detect

   ... Automatically detects AMD or nVidia video cards and loads the
       proprietary drivers at startup.  You must have a module
       containing the appropriate graphics driver (nVidia or amd-catalyst)
       stored in your /porteux/optional/ directory.  These modules
       are available in the download section of the Porteux website
       (www.porteux.org/download) for each edition and version of
       Porteux.  If you compile your own driver, please note that
       the module's name must begin with the string 'nVidia-' or
       'amd-catalyst' because the startup script searches for the driver
       modules by name.

       This cheatcode allows users to easily switch back and forth
       bewteen different hardware configurations while using the
       proprietary drivers because both driver modules can sit side
       by side in /porteux/optional/ without interfering with one
       another.  They are only activated when needed.

volume=some_value%

   ... This parameter sets the system's Master Volume channel to
       the value specified (as a percentage).  You will be able to raise
       or lower the volume after you boot up as normal.
       The default value is 75%.
       Example: 'volume=0%' will boot into your chosen GUI silently.

zram=some_value%

   ... enable the use of zram, which is a compressed block device
       inside your RAM that acts as a swap partition.  Zram operates
       faster than using swap on a hard drive and creates more
       (virtual) memory than using RAM alone because the data inside
       is compressed.  This will provide a performance boost on
       systems with low RAM, but it uses more processor cycles (to
       compress and decompress the data) than regular swap.
       Example: 'zram=33%' will set aside 33% of your RAM as a zram
       device.


SPECIAL NOTE FOR USING CHEATCODES WITH 'LABEL' AND 'UUID':
If you specify a LABEL or UUID with a cheatcode, remember that all
portions of these commands are case sensitive.  You should use a
unique label for each of your partitions if you wish to use device
labels with your cheatcodes. Use the 'blkid' command to view your
device's UUID and LABEL. Using UUID and LABEL can be quite handy
because they are unique to your device, and your data will be found
and properly mapped on different hardware configurations.
Every cheatcode which contains a /path can take advantage of 'UUID:'
and 'LABEL:' extensions.

Examples:
changes=UUID:STrING-0F-ChARACtERS/path/file.dat
extramod=LABEL:YourLabelName/path/to_folder/with_modules
from=UUID:STrING-0F-ChARACtERS/path/folder
rootcopy=LABEL:YourLabelName/path/to_folder/with_files


SPECIAL NOTE FOR USING CHANGES CHEATCODE WITH 'EXIT:' extension:
The 'EXIT:' extension tells the 'changes=' cheatcode to keep all
of the files that have been added/deleted/modified during the
live session stored in memory until you reboot/shutdown. Your
RAM works as a buffer which gets dumped on the drive only once,
when the session is finished.
'changes=EXIT:' cheatcode has following advantages:
- Porteux works as fast as in 'Always Fresh' mode as all modifications
  to files and folders are performed in RAM.
- reduced number of read/write cycles should extend the life of SSD
  drives and USB sticks.
The only disadvantage of the 'EXIT:' extension is that the session
does not get saved in cases where you experience a hang (kernel crash)
or power interrupt.
Please use with caution!

While you are running a session with changes=EXIT, you can use the
'dump-session' command (run as root from the command line) to move all 
of your changes from RAM to your storage media.  This will reduce the 
risk of data loss and free up your RAM.

Examples:
changes=EXIT:/dev/device
changes=EXIT:/path/
changes=EXIT:UUID:STrING-0F-ChARACtERS/path/file.dat


FINAL NOTE:
The cheatcodes listed above are those that are unique to Porteux.
There are literally hundreds of other kernel boot parameters
that can be used.  For more information on these parameters visit:
