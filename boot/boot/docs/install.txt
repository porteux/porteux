PorteuX can be installed to any media storage (including USB flash drive)
without requiring your personal data to be erased. Partitions supported:
ext2, ext3, ext4, FAT, exFAT, NTFS and XFS.

The simplest way to do that is copying the ISO content to your media
storage and running the installer, which will make the media bootable
(instructions below) and will set the correct permissions, not touching
or removing your existing data.

For better performance, it's recommended to have PorteuX installed on a
SSD/NVMe storage unit instead of a USB flash drive, or to select
'Copy To RAM' option in the boot menu. The later will have a slower
boot time, but after booting the system will be running 100% in RAM, 
which is the fastest way possible.

It's not recommended to use any third-party ISO installer application,
such as Rufus or Etcher because the media storage will be set to
read-only mode, making it impossible to write any data, including
automatic save changes.

First you need to choose between EFI or legacy boot process. Although
legacy is easier to set as it requires less steps, it's not supported
by all modern system. If you're in doubt, choose EFI.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| EFI System: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Make sure the first partition is of type FAT32.
2) Copy /boot and /EFI folders onto the FAT32 partition.
3) The second partition can be any of the supported ones and it will
contain /porteux folder.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Legacy System: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Copy /boot and /porteux folders onto the desired partition.

After completing the steps above, continue to the ones below
depending on the system you're setting the media storage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| From Windows: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Navigate into the /boot folder that you have just copied.
2) Run 'porteux-installer-for-windows.exe' and follow the instructions. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| From Linux: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Make sure the system has zstd installed.
2) Navigate into the /boot folder that you have just copied.
3) From the terminal, run 'sh porteux-installer-for-linux.run' and follow
the instructions.

| Conclusion: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running the installation program, you should be able to boot 
PorteuX from your media storage. Reboot your computer, and make sure that
your BIOS is set to boot from the media storage where PorteuX is installed.

| Notes: |
~~~~~~~~~~

1) If your media storage is formatted with a Linux filesystem
(e.g. EXT4 or XFS), before the first boot make sure the folder
/porteux has your current user ownership (e.g. 'guest') otherwise
changes will not be automatically saved.

2) If your media storage is formatted with a Windows filesystem
(e.g. FAT or NTFS), the changes you make to your system will not be 
automatically saved. In this case, you can create a '.dat' file
container using PorteuX Save Session application after the boot, or use
/porteux/rootcopy folder to save only what you need (cleaner and faster).
