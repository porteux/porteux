PorteuX can be installed to any media storage (including USB flash drive)
without requiring your personal data to be erased. Partitions supported:
ext2, ext3, ext4, FAT, exFAT, NTFS and XFS.

The simplest way to do that is copying the ISO content to your media
storage and running the installer, which will make the media bootable
(instructions below) and will set the correct permissions, not touching
or removing your existing data. Just make sure your partition is of type
'msdos' or 'gpt'.

For better performance, it's recommended to install PorteuX on an SSD or
NVMe storage unit rather than a USB flash drive. Alternatively, you can
select 'Copy to RAM' option in the boot menu. While this will increase
RAM usage and may result in a slightly slower boot time, once the system
is up and running, it will perform at its fastest, as it will be running
100% in RAM.

Please notice that a CPU with SSE4.2 is required to run PorteuX.

It's not recommended to use any third-party ISO installer application,
such as Rufus or Etcher because the media storage is usually set to
read-only mode, making it impossible to write any data, including
automatic save changes.

First you need to choose between EFI or legacy boot process. Although
legacy is easier to set as it requires less steps, it's not supported
by all modern system. If you're in doubt, choose EFI.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| EFI System: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Make sure the first partition is of type FAT32.
2) Copy '/boot' and '/EFI' folders onto the FAT32 partition.
3) The second partition can be either this FAT32 one or any of the
supported ones, and it will contain '/porteux' folder.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Legacy System: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Copy '/boot' and '/porteux' folders onto the desired partition.

-----

After completing the steps above, continue to the ones below
depending on the system you're setting the media storage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| From Windows: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Navigate into '/boot' folder that you have just copied.
2) Run 'porteux-installer-for-windows.exe' and follow the instructions. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| From Linux: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Make sure the system has zstd installed.
2) Navigate into '/boot' folder that you have just copied.
3) From the terminal, run 'sh porteux-installer-for-linux.run' and follow
the instructions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Conclusion: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running the installation program, you should be able to boot PorteuX
from your media storage. Reboot your computer and ensure that your BIOS
is set to boot from the media storage where '/boot' and '/EFI' have been
copied.

| Notes: |
~~~~~~~~~~

1) If your media storage is formatted with a Linux filesystem (e.g. EXT4
or XFS), make sure that '/porteux' folder is owned by your current
user (e.g., 'guest') before the first boot. Otherwise, changes will not be
automatically saved.

2) If your media storage is formatted with a Windows filesystem (e.g. FAT
or NTFS), changes you make to your system will not be automatically saved.
In this case, you can create a '.dat' file container or a module using the
PorteuX Save Session application after booting, or use the
'/porteux/rootcopy' folder to save only what you need (cleaner and faster).
