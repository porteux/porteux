xcape: xcape (Linux utility to configure modifier keys)
xcape:
xcape: xcape allows you to use a modifier key as another key when pressed and
xcape: released on its own. Note that it is slightly slower than pressing the
xcape: original key, because the pressed event does not occur until the key
xcape: is released.
xcape:
xcape: The default behaviour is to generate the Escape key when Left Control
xcape: is pressed and released on its own.
