labwc: labwc (Lab Wayland Compositor)
labwc:
labwc: Labwc is a wlroots-based window-stacking compositor for Wayland,
labwc: inspired by openbox. It is lightweight and independent with a focus on
labwc: simply stacking windows well and rendering some window decorations. It
labwc: takes a no-bling/frills approach and says no to features such as
labwc: animations. It relies on clients for panels, screenshots, wallpapers
labwc: and so on to create a full desktop environment.
