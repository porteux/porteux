# Most login managers just start Xorg as root, so the setuid wrapper is mostly
# designed for console users who start Xorg with the "startx" script. You may
# adjust who can start Xorg through the setuid wrapper. The choices are:
# rootonly - only root can start through the wrapper. This is meaningless since
# Xorg will run as root even without the wrapper when root starts it.
# console - console users may start X through the wrapper (this is default).
# anybody - let anybody start X through the setuid wrapper.
