launcher:
launcher: Modular IPC-based desktop launcher service, written in Rust. Desktop
launcher: launchers may interface with this service via spawning the
launcher: pop-launcher process and communicating to it via JSON IPC over the
launcher: stdin and stdout pipes. The launcher service will also spawn plugins
launcher: found in plugin directories on demand, based on the queries sent to
launcher: the service. Using IPC enables each plugin to isolate their data
launcher: from other plugin processes and frontends that are interacting with
launcher: them.
